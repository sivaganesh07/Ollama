To process the JSON data as requested, we will use Python's built-in `json` and `pandas` libraries for handling the JSON file and performing data manipulation, respectively. Here's a step-by-step approach to accomplish the task:

**Step 1:** Import necessary libraries and load the JSON data into a pandas DataFrame

```python
import json
import pandas as pd

# Load the JSON data into a pandas DataFrame
data = pd.read_json('data.json')
```

**Step 2:** Extract the "STORE" and the year from the "TRANSACTION_DATE" for each object

```python
data['Year'] = pd.to_datetime(data['TRANSACTION_DATE']).dt.year
data['STORE'] = data['TRANSACTION_DATE'].str[:8]  # Extract first 8 characters as STORE values
```

**Step 3:** Group the data by "STORE" and extracted year

```python
grouped = data.groupby(['STORE', 'Year'])
```

**Step 4:** Calculate the sum of "AMOUNT" for each unique combination of "STORE" and year

```python
total_amounts = grouped['AMOUNT'].sum()
```

**Step 5:** Present the results in a clear and concise format

```python
for store, year, total_amount in zip(data['STORE'], total_amounts.index, total_amounts.values):
    print(f'Store: {store}, Year: {year}, Total Amount: {total_amount}')
```

This will output the results as requested for each unique combination of "STORE" and year with their respective total amounts.
